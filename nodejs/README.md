This fully works, but getting the hotspot to work when there is not internet is a challenge. 
I purchased a usb-WiFi adaptor which did help but did not make it any easier to work with such as the [$20 USD  Amazon.com Archer T3U](https://www.amazon.ca/TP-Link-Archer-T3U-Adapter-Wireless/dp/B07P6N2TZH)



Basically with NodeJS and npm installed
and the github repository downloaded and unzipped on your computer
navigate to the repository nodejs folder and run
npm install ws which will put the node-modules folder in that directory then just run

node node-server.js

localhost will generate your websocket.
